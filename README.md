## About FEQRScanViewController

Coming soon!

## Usage

### Import

1. Import `AVFoundation.framework` into your Project
2. Add `FEQRScanViewController.swift` to your Project
3. Have fun!

### Code examples

Simply presenting the scanner:
```swift
let scanner = FEQRScanViewController()
presentViewController(scanner, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Presenting the scanner in a `UINavigationController` and setting its Close-Button title:
```swift
let scanner = FEQRScanViewController(closeTitle: "Ciao!")

let navController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: scanner)
presentViewController(navController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

In order to receive a result from the scanner, you'll need to implement the `FEQRScanViewControllerDelegate` protocol and set the `delegate` property of the scanner accordingly:
```swift
let scanner = FEQRScanViewController()
scanner.delegate = self
```

Furthermore you'll also need to implement the `didScanCodeWithResult()` protocol function. The result is passed as a String:
```swift
func didScanCodeWithResult(result: String) {
    print("Scanner returned result: \(result)")
}
```
